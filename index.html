    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>
      I am the youngest member of a family of 4. There is my mom, brother, and sister. My mom and dad divorced a long time ago but us siblings still visit from time to time (he lives in Taiwan). Now that all of the children have graduated from high school (and collge by now) my mom now lives mostly in Taiwan. My brother currently lives in New York because of work while my sister lives in Seattle. I also have a cousin who is currently going to the University of Washington so I often see him as well. I have 4 other cousins from my mom's side of the family; one lives in California with her husband, one lives in Pennsylvania where she works, one lives in Massachusetts where she is going to school while the last cousin just found work in Amsterdam.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My current goal is to get a job within the tech field as a software developer. A more long-term goal of mine would be to develop a game. I find games very enjoyable and they can serve a larger purpose besides being fun (though they don't have to). I just think that it would be fun and interesting to develop a game. Other things that interest me in this field would be working with augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robots, and creating computer applications.

    <h2>Last Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Over the summer of 2017 I was a full time seasonal park aide at St. Edwards State Park. It was an interesting experience there as it was a park situated in the middle of a rather developed area. This made it so that many park visitors were here to have their kids play on the playground, have a picnic, or walk their dogs. This made it so that a lot of the work that I had to do was more groundskeeping like mowing, taking out the garbage, and picking up litter. The picture below is of the St. Edwards seminary building which used to be a catholic school until State Parks aquired it and the land surrounding it in 1977. The building has fallen into disrepair over time as the park didn't have the funding or the staff to maintain it. The building will soon be restored by Daniels Reality after an agreement with State Parks in 2016 where it will be changed into a lodge.
